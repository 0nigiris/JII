# JII — AI Context (Current State)

> **Purpose:** the single-page current state of the project, so any agent (AI or
> human) can pick up development in under five minutes. This file describes **only
> the present** — no history. History lives in git; decisions in
> [DECISIONS.md](DECISIONS.md); the plan in [TASKS.md](TASKS.md).

> **Keep this file current.** Updating it at the end of every session is mandatory

## What JII is

A smart universal package **installer** (not a manager) for Linux, in Rust,
Fedora-first. It searches multiple sources (DNF, Flatpak, and — soon — GitHub
Releases, COPR…), ranks them, installs the best, and explains why. Read
[CLAUDE.md](../CLAUDE.md) for binding constraints and
[ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md) for the canonical design.

## Current phase

**Phase 4 — GitHub Releases, COPR & trust** (in progress). Phases 0–3 are complete
and verified (skeleton → DNF end-to-end → state/remove/why → multi-source ranking +
cache + doctor).

## Last completed work

**GitHub `.zip` release assets** — `exec::extract` now dispatches on the archive's
file-name extension into `read_tar_gz` / `read_zip` (both decode to the same
`ArchiveFile` list, so member selection + writing stay format-agnostic — the seam
ADR-0016 predicted). github's `classify` gained `AssetKind::Zip` (ranked below `TarGz`,
which preserves unix modes) and now rejects delta-patch assets
(`.bsdiff`/`.patch`/`.delta`/`.zsync`) that used to masquerade as raw binaries —
surfaced by `denoland/deno`, which ships a `*.bsdiff` next to its Linux `.zip`. Verified:
real-release dry-run selects `deno-…-linux-gnu.zip` → Extract; zip round-trip
(create→extract→assert bytes+mode) unit-tested; the untrusted trust barrier correctly
refused a non-interactive real install (ADR-0006). Added the `zip` crate
(`default-features=false`, `deflate`). See ADR-0016 (2026-07-04 update).

Also this session (docs only): **ADR-0020** (JII is a universal layer, not another
package manager) and **ADR-0021** (integrate external backends like UPAC only via their
stable public API, as another `Provider`; implement nothing until that API exists), plus
new ROADMAP Future ideas (more managers, bootstrapping a missing manager, provider-supplied
metadata).

Prior Phase 4 slices, all verified end-to-end: `jii doctor` health/rate-limit (ADR-0019);
`jii audit` (ADR-0018); COPR provider (ADR-0017); `Action::Extract` + `.tar.gz` (ADR-0016);
github `jii remove` (`Provider::is_installed`); GitHub Releases provider (ADR-0014); the
execution model (`Action` enum + `exec.rs`, ADR-0007).

## Current task

None in progress — pick the next recommended task below.

## Next recommended task

Phase 4's core is complete. What remains is polish/hardening (revisit before starting
Phase 5). Note several former "follow-ups" are now **documented future features**, not
quick tasks — do not implement them as silent heuristics:

1. **GitHub repository selection** (was "broad name→repo resolution") — interactive,
   "never silently install the wrong repo" (ROADMAP Future ideas). Not blind resolution.
2. `.tar.xz` archives — deferred; needs an xz decoder dependency for little gain yet.
3. Better COPR project disambiguation if the chroot-count heuristic proves weak.
4. Real GPG/sigstore verification in `exec.rs::verify_bytes` (currently fail-closed).

Otherwise Phase 4 is done; **Phase 5** (user-space sources: cargo/npm/pipx/go) is the
next phase, only if the architecture stays clean (each is a `Provider`, no core branching).

Full list in [TASKS.md](TASKS.md) Phase 4.

## Current blockers

None.

## Build status

`cargo build` — clean, no warnings. `cargo clippy` — clean.

## Test status

`cargo test` — **76 passing, 0 failing**. Coverage: dnf/flatpak parsers, ranking,
registry, cache, privilege elevation prefixing, the executor (sha256 digest,
verification accept/reject/case-insensitive/fail-closed, place+mode+remove, tar.gz **and
zip** extract + member selection, unknown-format rejection, run_action), github
(owner/repo, release JSON, asset selection incl. `.zip`/tar.gz preference, checksums,
plan shapes), copr (search parsing, exact-name + fedora/arch chroot selection, two-step
root plan), audit (verification resolution + concern logic), and doctor health mapping
(`health_from` precedence).

## Environment & commands

- **Target/dev OS:** Fedora (dnf5). Rust edition 2024.
- **Build:** `cargo build` (must be warning-clean).
- **Lint:** `cargo clippy` (installed; must be clean).
- **Test:** `cargo test`.
- **Preview a plan:** `cargo run -- install <pkg> --dry-run` (no side effects).
- **`cargo fmt` / `rustfmt` are NOT installed** on this dev host — match the
  surrounding code style by hand; do not rely on `cargo fmt`.
- External tools invoked at runtime: `dnf5`, `flatpak`, `sudo`/`pkexec`. GitHub
  provider (next) will use HTTPS via `reqwest` and optionally `GITHUB_TOKEN`.
- **CI** (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) runs clippy (`-D warnings`) + tests on every
  push/PR — the automated Definition of Done (ADR-0013). The runner has no
  dnf5/flatpak, so end-to-end `--dry-run` checks stay manual on Fedora.

## Important architectural decisions (quick reference)

Full rationale in [DECISIONS.md](DECISIONS.md). The load-bearing ones:

- **Core never branches on source** — everything behind the `Provider` trait (ADR-0004).
- **`Plan` is first-class** — declarative `Action`s, always previewable via `--dry-run`
  (ADR-0003), executed by `exec.rs` (ADR-0007).
- **JII never fully root** — only concrete steps escalate, via `privilege.rs` (ADR-0005).
- **Trust threshold, not global yes** — `untrusted` always confirmed (ADR-0006).
- **Single crate**, **JSON registry** (not SQLite), **`PkgVersion(String)`** not semver
  (ADR-0001/0002/0009).

## Known technical debt

- **COPR project ambiguity** — several projects can share a package name; we pick the
  exact-name match building for the most Fedora chroots, but that is a weak signal (a
  fork may build widely). The visible `owner/project` in the plan + confirmation is the
  safety net. A real popularity/quality metric isn't in the search API (ADR-0017).
- **GitHub archives: `.tar.gz`/`.tgz` + `.zip`** — `.tar.xz`-only releases still yield
  no candidate (ADR-0016); adding it means an xz decoder dependency. `.zip` entries
  authored on non-unix systems carry no mode, so the sole-executable fallback can't fire
  — the exact-basename match still resolves the common single-binary case.
- **GitHub binary named after the repo** — the placed file is `~/.local/bin/<repo>`;
  when the archive's binary basename differs (e.g. ripgrep's `rg`), it's still
  installed as `<repo>`. Fine for now (repo==binary in the common case).
- **Flatpak identified by appid** (`org.gimp.GIMP`): `jii remove gimp` may not resolve
  a Flatpak by friendly name. Revisit with a name/id split if it becomes painful.
- **`latest`/`minimal` profiles + freshness/health ranking tie-breakers** are reserved
  — they need comparable versions / dependency-footprint data not yet collected.
- **GPG / sigstore verification** are stubbed to fail closed in `exec.rs::verify_bytes`
  — implement when a source needs them (GitHub).
- **`cli/mod.rs`** (~410 lines) holds command handlers inline; split into
  `cli/commands/*` if it grows unwieldy.

## Where things live

  engine/        orchestration (search→rank→plan→execute) + ranking.rs
  exec.rs        plan executor (the one place that runs a plan's actions)
  privilege.rs   sudo/pkexec elevation (prime + run)
  cache.rs       on-disk TTL search cache (stale-on-error)

To add a source: implement `Provider` (or a declarative TOML later) — never edit the
core. Use the `/new-provider` skill.
